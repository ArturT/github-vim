== Description

This is a quick and dirty vim plugin to use with the scripts included in 
github-tmbundle written by drnic, available at http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle

It enables you to select a section of a file in a local repository (in visual mode), and
open a direct link to the corresponding file in the github remote repository, including
your selection.

== Suggested installation

1. Goto http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle and copy tree/master/Support/lib/show_in_github.rb
   to ~/lib/show_in_github.rb

2. Copy github.vim to ~/.vim/plugins/github.vim

3. Copy open_github.rb to ~/bin/open_github.rb

The resulting file structure:

  ~/.vim/plugins/github.vim
  ~/lib/show_in_github.rb
  ~/bin/open_github.rb

4. Create a mapping in your ~/.vimrc

  map <F5> :call Gitopen()<cr>

== Usage

Select some code, and press F5 :)

== Notes

Since this is one of my first vim plugins, feel free to send patches :)
