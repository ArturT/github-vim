== Description

This is a quick and dirty vim plugin to use with the scripts included in 
github-tmbundle written by drnic, available at http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle

It enables you to:
  
  - open a link to the corresponding github file of a local vim selection
  - add a comment to the corresponding github commit of a locally selected line

== Suggested installation

The file structure should be clear, root is your $HOME

Example mapping for ~/.vimrc

map <F5> :call Gitopen()<cr>
map <F6> :call Gitcomment()<cr>

== Usage

Select some code/a line and press F5/F6 :)

== Notes

The files in /lib/drnic are contained in http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle, written by drnic.

Since this is one of my first vim plugins, feel free to send corrections or improvements :)
