== Description

This is a quick and dirty vim to use some github functionality from vim.
This branch uses the the scripts included in github-tmbundle written by drnic,
available at http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle

It enables you to:
  
  - open a link to the corresponding github file of a local vim selection
  - add a comment to the corresponding github commit of a locally selected line

== Suggested installation

The file structure should be clear, root is your $HOME

== Usage

  - Comment Commit: on the relevant line Press 'ghc' in normal mode
  - Open Selection: create a selection in visual mode and press 'gho'

To remap the keybinding in your ~/.vimrc use:

  - map <F5> <Plug>GithubOpen
  - map <F6> <Plug>GithubComment

== Notes

The files in /lib/drnic are contained in http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle, written by drnic.

Since this is one of my first vim plugins, feel free to send corrections or improvements :)
